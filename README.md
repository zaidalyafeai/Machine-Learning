# Machine-Learning

This repository implements most of the machine learning algorithm as ipython notebooks. The implemented algorithms so far are 

## Regression 
* Linear regression using normal equations
* Linear regression using SGD
* Locally Weighted Regress (LOWESS)

## Classification 
* Logistic regression classifier
* softmax classifier 

## Optimization methods 
* Newton

## Deep Learning
* MNIST training Pytorch 
* Pretrained model resnet for ImageNet Pytorch
